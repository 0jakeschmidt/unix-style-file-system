DISK
disk class will fake disk
all we have to do is read it
bit vector- keep track of empty blocks on system
on startup- format and fill bit vector
no warnings
disk manager is important

when in the linux machines:
ghex to read the files system
3 partitions: abc
will never be able to read bit vector: store len of filesystem in bits
#'s are blanks
dont change drivers except driver6
dont change Disk
